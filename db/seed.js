In fact, it is a rather special malting barley we use. We have our own Barley Breeding Group, which works in close contact with our brewmasters.\n\nThe group selects the barley with the best traits and grows it in our research fields, using only traditional breeding methods, 100% free of genetic modifications. Considering that Carlsberg is made from 100% pure malt i.e. no adjuncts it could take some years before we breed the necessary amount of barley. Probably worth the effort.\n\nHops are our secret ingredient. Of course it is no secret that we use hops in our beer, but the types we use are prepared according to a secret recipe that’s exclusive to us. It’s called the Carlsberg Aroma Hop Extract and nobody but us at Carlsberg can use it. After all, there can only be one best beer in the world.\n\nYeast is at the heart of our history. In 1879, Carlsberg was the first brewery to produce a purified brewer’s yeast, the Saccharomyces Carlsbergensis. Since then we’ve been constantly working to improve our yeast’s taste and the stability of our beer.

Charles convinced us to export our old kriek to the United States by boat. What we had not thought of is that the movement of the waves would reactivate the fermentation process and cause the corks to pop during the trip. It was like something out of The Adventures of Tintin. To prevent that from happening, we therefore developed an alternative production method for our kriek. We use fresh, not from concentrate, unsweetened cherry filtrate which we blend with lambic that is at least one year old before fermenting & macerating for up to 3 days and pasteurising the whole batch. So the corks don't pop.\n\n\nDue to the use of filtrate and pasteurisation, this kriek is sweeter and fruitier than Old Kriek Cuvée René, which undergoes a second fermentation process in the bottle. Thanks to its innovative flavour, it was a resounding success both here in Belgium as well as around the world.

Dark & delicious, America’s milk stout will change your perception about what a stout can be.  Pouring hard out of the bottle, Milk Stout Nitro cascades beautifully, building a tight, thick head like hard whipped cream. The aroma is of brown sugar and vanilla cream, with hints of roasted coffee. The pillowy head coats your upper lip and its creaminess entices your palate. Initial roasty, mocha flavors rise up, with slight hop & roast bitterness in the finish. The rest is pure bless of milk chocolate fullness.\n\nFamous for their Nitro series, Left Hand Brewing was the first craft brewery to release a bottled nitrogenated beer.
